<h2> This repository is to collect progress of 60 days of Udacity challenge. </h2>
I was having my board exams lately so it was harder for me to collect everything i studied here.

   <td>Today i used the log_softmax function on final layer of my CNN, then the problem of accuracy solved. Yesterday's miracle was due to randomization of parameters.</td>
