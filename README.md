<h2> This repository is to collect progress of 60 days of Udacity challenge. </h2>
I was having my board exams lately so it was harder for me to collect everything i studied here.

   <td>24</td>
   <td> Also i watched Federated learning with trusted aggregator video.</td>
   <td></td>
   <td>Today i used the log_softmax function on final layer of my CNN, then the problem of accuracy solved. Yesterday's miracle was due to randomization of parameters.</td>

 <tr>
  <td>25</td>
  <td>Trained DCR all characters using Pytorch. Plus I learned about deep dream.</td>

  <td>26</td>
  <td>Did lots of task. Downloaded, processed and trained a CNN for smog detection.</td>
